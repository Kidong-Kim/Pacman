# Pacman - Multi-Agent Search

## Abstract

- [Project for CS188](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa21/project2/) - "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" at UC Berkeley during Fall 2021.
- Created the classic version of the Pacman, including agents with different characteristics using Python
- Implemented foundational AI concepts including informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning
- The code is based on skeleton code from the class. Project was completed using the PyCharm Python IDE. This submission received full score.

## Project description

![Pacman](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0f3f9a6773aec44f398aa1934aeef75e760fd96538b99ddb3ae28f2e53affead/687474703a2f2f61692e6265726b656c65792e6564752f696d616765732f7061636d616e5f67616d652e676966)

Implemented Minimax tree to find the most optimal move, Alpha-Beta pruning to explore Minimax search tree, and Expectimax search to model probabilistic behavior.

Designed an Evaluation function computing rewards of the agents at the given state.
