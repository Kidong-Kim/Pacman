- Created the classic version of the Pacman including agents with different characteristics using Python
- Implemented Minimax tree to find the most optimal move, Alpha-Beta pruning to explore Minimax search tree, and Expectimax search to model probabilistic behavior
- Designed an Evaluation function computing rewards of the agents at the given state
